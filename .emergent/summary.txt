The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Team Wellness Company's landing page, integrating Sign In and Learn More modals with key design elements and content. The major undertaking involved implementing functional Google OAuth SSO, which evolved into a complex debugging and deployment challenge. The engineer navigated persistent GitHub push protection errors by meticulously moving secrets to local-only files and extensively cleaning git history. Subsequently, deployment to Railway encountered multiple dependency issues (, , , ) and configuration problems ( format, ). The engineer systematically addressed these by creating minimal server configurations and guiding the user through platform-specific adjustments. The current state is a successfully deployed backend on Railway with working Google OAuth, ready for frontend integration and further SSO development.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a comprehensive redesign of the Team Wellness Company landing page. This involved transforming the main interface into two interactive modals: Sign In and Learn More. The Sign In modal required Apple, Google, and X (Twitter) SSO options, alongside corporate/individual login fields. The Learn More modal was to feature About Us, pricing tiers, a Sign Up Today! CTA, and specific contact details (email: , Calendly: ). Design consistency was critical, mandating adherence to existing font colors, SensaWild-Fill font, and a blue-green gradient background (later replaced with an image). The Team Welly logo needed to precisely match a user-provided image. Content for Learn More included a mission statement, 5-step framework, pricing, corporate wellness info, and FAQ. Subsequent requests included adding LinkedIn hyperlinks with icons, changing wellness app to wellness platform, and incorporating a Legal Notice link with a placeholder pop-up in the footer. The most recent explicit request was to implement functional SSO, starting with Google OAuth, and then address frontend integration and deployment.

<code_architecture>
The application has a full-stack architecture with a React/Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   : The main landing page defining UI structure and containing JavaScript for modal interactivity and frontend OAuth calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Buttons replaced, modals for Sign In/Learn More added, logo images updated, LinkedIn links, Legal Notice link/modal added. JavaScript added to handle Google OAuth redirection to backend .
-   : Central stylesheet for visual design.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive styling for new modals,  incorporated, logo styling adjusted for image tags, new styles for LinkedIn and Legal Notice.
-   : Main FastAPI application, serving as the backend entry point.
    -   **Changes Made**: SessionMiddleware added for OAuth.  (from ) included. Temporary changes involved commenting out , , ,  routers to isolate dependency issues during Railway deployment. Logic was added to load environment variables from  for local development.
-   : Environment variables for backend, now holding placeholder values for sensitive data.
    -   **Changes Made**: Google OAuth  and  were initially added, then replaced with placeholders to prevent committing secrets. Placeholder entries for Apple and Twitter/X OAuth were also added.
-   : New file to store actual sensitive OAuth credentials for local development, excluded from Git.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to hold Google OAuth  and  to bypass GitHub push protection.
-   : New Python file for handling OAuth logic (Google, Apple, X).
    -   **Changes Made**: Implements endpoints for Google OAuth initiation () and callback (). Includes placeholder structures for Apple and Twitter/X OAuth. Logic to handle  from environment and dynamically construct  using .
-   : Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: , ,  were added.  was temporarily removed to resolve deployment issues.
-   : A temporary, simplified FastAPI server used for debugging Railway deployment.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created as a barebones server to verify basic functionality and OAuth endpoints without dependency on  or other complex application routers, to aid deployment troubleshooting.
-   : Specifies files/patterns to be ignored by Git.
    -   **Changes Made**: ,  and potentially other temporary files were added to ensure sensitive data and build artifacts are not committed.
-   : Contains testing protocols and results.
    -   **Changes Made**: Was found to contain sensitive credentials, which were then removed.

<pending_tasks>
All explicit user requests concerning the landing page functionality and initial Google OAuth setup (including securing credentials and getting it working on Railway) have been addressed. There are no explicitly *pending* tasks from the previous turn that were not implemented. The AI engineer is now awaiting new instructions.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved multiple complex deployment and configuration issues related to the Google OAuth integration on Railway.

The backend is now successfully deployed and running on Railway at . The Google OAuth flow is fully functional and has been verified:
1.  **Environment Variables**: The  and  are correctly configured as environment variables within Railway, and the backend successfully retrieves them.
2.  **OAuth Flow**: Initiating the Google OAuth flow via  correctly redirects to Google for authentication. Upon successful authentication, Google redirects back to the configured callback URI (), which then displays a ðŸŽ‰ OAuth Success! page, confirming the successful exchange of the authorization code.
3.  **Deployment Robustness**: To achieve this state, the engineer performed extensive troubleshooting, which included:
    *   **GitHub Security**: Ensuring  and  are NOT committed to GitHub by moving them to  (which is git-ignored) and performing git history clean-up.
    *   **Railway Deployment Fixes**: Resolving numerous  errors during Railway deployments (, , ) by adding missing packages to  and, critically, by temporarily commenting out sections of the main  (, , ,  routers) that depended on the problematic  library. A  was created to test a barebones working server.
    *   **OAuth Configuration Debugging**: Rectifying Missing required parameter: client_id and redirect_uri_mismatch errors by guiding the user to correctly configure environment variables on Railway and ensuring the Google Cloud Console's authorized redirect URIs matched the Railway deployment URL.

The application's backend is in a stable state with functional Google OAuth, ready for frontend integration and re-enabling/implementing the full application logic on Railway.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to update the frontend JavaScript to use the Railway backend URL and provide instructions for deploying the frontend on Railway, followed by implementing Apple and X OAuth.
