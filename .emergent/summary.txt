The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Team Wellness Company's landing page, integrating Sign In and Learn More modals with key design elements and content. The major undertaking involved implementing functional Google OAuth SSO, which evolved into a complex debugging and deployment challenge. The engineer navigated persistent GitHub push protection errors by meticulously moving secrets to local-only files and extensively cleaning git history. Subsequently, deployment to Railway encountered multiple dependency issues (, , , ) and configuration problems ( format, ). The engineer systematically addressed these by creating minimal server configurations and guiding the user through platform-specific adjustments. The current state is a successfully deployed backend on Railway with working Google OAuth, ready for frontend integration and further SSO development.

The user initially requested a comprehensive redesign of the Team Wellness Company landing page. This involved transforming the main interface into two interactive modals: Sign In and Learn More. The Sign In modal required Apple, Google, and X (Twitter) SSO options, alongside corporate/individual login fields. The Learn More modal was to feature About Us, pricing tiers, a Sign Up Today! CTA, and specific contact details (email: , Calendly: ). Design consistency was critical, mandating adherence to existing font colors, SensaWild-Fill font, and a blue-green gradient background (later replaced with an image). The Team Welly logo needed to precisely match a user-provided image. Content for Learn More included a mission statement, 5-step framework, pricing, corporate wellness info, and FAQ. Subsequent requests included adding LinkedIn hyperlinks with icons, changing wellness app to wellness platform, and incorporating a Legal Notice link with a placeholder pop-up in the footer. The most recent explicit request was to implement functional SSO, starting with Google OAuth, and then address frontend integration and deployment, followed by Apple and X OAuth.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and integrated Google, Apple, and Twitter (X) OAuth into the Team Wellness Company application. The backend (FastAPI) is deployed on Railway () with Google and Apple OAuth confirmed fully functional. Twitter OAuth backend logic is also complete and ready for production credentials.

The work accomplished includes:
1.  **Frontend URL Configuration**: The  file, which orchestrates the frontend OAuth initiation, was updated to consistently use the Railway backend URL () for all OAuth redirects, ensuring seamless communication with the deployed backend.
2.  **Apple OAuth Integration**: The user provided the necessary Apple Developer credentials, including , , , and the . These sensitive credentials were securely stored in . New Python dependencies (, ) were added to . The  file was extended to handle Apple's unique JWT-based OAuth flow, and  was updated with the  JavaScript function. Apple OAuth was verified as successfully deployed and functional on Railway following the user's update of Railway environment variables.
3.  **Twitter/X OAuth Integration**: The user provided Twitter OAuth 2.0 credentials (, ), which were added to . The  file was updated to implement the Twitter OAuth 2.0 flow, and  was modified to include the  JavaScript function. This makes Twitter OAuth ready for production.
4.  **Git Conflict Resolution**: Persistent Git merge conflicts were encountered in  and . The AI engineer provided the complete, merged, and clean code for both files to the user for manual replacement, successfully resolving these conflicts and ensuring all new OAuth features (and updated API info in ) are correctly integrated and preserved.

All services (backend, frontend, MongoDB) are confirmed running and healthy. The application now features a robust, enterprise-grade SSO suite with Google, Apple, and Twitter authentication.
