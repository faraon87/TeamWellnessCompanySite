The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a major refactor and feature expansion for the Team Wellness Company, moving from a basic landing page to one with interactive modals and comprehensive SSO. Initial work included integrating Sign In and Learn More modals, design elements, and basic content. The core challenge became implementing functional Google, Apple, and X (Twitter) OAuth SSO, compounded by persistent GitHub push protection issues and complex Railway deployment failures. The AI engineer systematically debugged environment variable loading, Python pathing, and Railway's aggressive caching and server detection mechanisms. Multiple strategies were attempted, including explicit server file renames, adding diagnostic endpoints, and force-refreshing deployments. Despite extensive debugging, including a nuclear reset of the Railway service and identifying Node.js autodetection, the application still failed to deploy correctly, ending with an Application not found error. The primary challenge throughout the trajectory was Railway's inconsistent behavior in picking up code changes and proper server startup commands.

The initial request aimed to transform the Team Wellness Company landing page into two interactive modals: Sign In and Learn More. The Sign In modal required Google, Apple, and X (Twitter) SSO, plus corporate/individual login. The Learn More modal needed About Us, pricing, a Sign Up Today! CTA, and contact details. Design elements like font, gradient background (later an image), and logo fidelity were critical. Subsequent requests included LinkedIn hyperlinks and a Legal Notice link. The main ongoing requirement was to implement functional SSO for Google, Apple, and X, integrating with a Railway-deployed backend, followed by frontend deployment and domain migration from Squarespace to Railway. The current focus in the trajectory was completing X OAuth and the full migration to Railway hosting.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a prolonged effort to deploy the FastAPI backend, specifically ensuring the Twitter/X OAuth functionality, to Railway. The core issue was Railway consistently serving old or cached versions of the application, despite numerous attempts to update the code, change server entry points, and force redeployments.

The previous engineer had successfully confirmed the Twitter OAuth backend logic was functional locally and had instructed the user to add the X OAuth credentials to Railway environment variables. The user confirmed adding these.

However, subsequent deployments to Railway continued to show old API information (version 1.0.0 instead of 2.1.0), and the Twitter OAuth endpoint remained inaccessible (404 Not Found). The debugging process involved:
1.  **Verifying  and **: Ensuring they contained the correct OAuth logic and updated version numbers.
2.  **Modifying  and adding **: To explicitly define the backend's start command.
3.  **Renaming server files (e.g., to , , )**: As cache-busting measures.
4.  **Creating a  and moving  to root**: To influence Railway's build process.
5.  **Adding debug endpoints ()**: To verify environment variables and code version on the deployed server.
6.  **Extensive analysis of Railway deployment logs**: Which repeatedly showed that Railway *was* running the intended, updated server file (), but responses were still stale.

The latest critical discovery was that Railway's custom start command was explicitly pointing to . The AI engineer then created this  file with all the correct and updated code.

Despite this, the service continued to return old responses, leading to an investigation into Railway's serverless mode (which was enabled and causing caching/cold start issues) and eventual disabling of it. Even after disabling serverless and adding cache-busting headers, the old responses persisted.

The last major attempt involved a nuclear reset where the user deleted and recreated the Railway service from scratch, setting the custom start command to . However, this redeployment failed, with logs indicating python: command not found and Nixpacks detecting the project as Node.js due to . The  and  files were then renamed to prevent this auto-detection, and the  was explicitly updated to point to .

The *immediate* current state is that after these latest changes (renaming frontend files, updating ), the user attempted another deployment, which resulted in an Application not found (404) error, indicating a new deployment failure.

Investigate the Application not found error by checking the Railway deployment status and logs for specific error messages or reasons for failure.
