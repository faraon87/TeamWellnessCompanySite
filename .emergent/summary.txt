The previous AI engineer initiated a comprehensive revamp of the Team Welly health and wellness application. The initial task involved understanding a pre-existing React/Vite codebase, which was initially misinterpreted as a full-stack application. After correction, the engineer proceeded with Phase 1: Frontend Foundation and Setup, which included installing dependencies, configuring PWA capabilities, and scaffolding numerous placeholder components for the entire application (onboarding, dashboard, programs, coaching, admin, challenges, settings, membership). Significant effort was spent debugging deployment issues on Vercel, particularly related to  configuration and general frontend rendering problems, leading to the creation of simplified, bulletproof frontend versions to ensure base functionality. Subsequently, Phase 2 commenced, focusing on Backend Integration. This involved setting up a FastAPI backend, installing Python dependencies, structuring API routers for authentication, payments, and an AI chatbot, and integrating the frontend with this new backend. A critical decision was made to use a mocked database initially as MongoDB setup proved problematic in the environment. The current work halted mid-way through frontend-backend integration.

The user requested a complete revamp of the Team Welly app to be intuitive for iOS and web, designed for a health and wellness company. The detailed UI/UX specification outlined the following core functionalities:
1.  **Onboarding Flow**: Welcome page with intro video, Login/Sign-Up (company code/email, individual plan), Wellness Goal Setting, Baseline Self-Assessment, and Device Integration Prompt.
2.  **Dashboard (Daily Hub)**: Today's Suggestions, Progress Rings (daily, weekly, device data), Upcoming Bookings, and WellyPoints Tracker.
3.  **Programs & Library**: Categories (Stretch & Mobility, Pain to Performance, Strength Foundations, Breath & Stress, Workplace Wellness, Mindset & Growth) with subcategories, program overviews (videos, daily flow tracker), bookmarking, and Add to My Plan features.
4.  **Live Coaching / Events**: 1-on-1 Session Booking, Group Zoom Sessions (upcoming, register, replay library), and Custom Coaching Topic requests.
5.  **HR/Admin Portal**: Company Dashboard (user engagement, top programs, coaching attendance), Send Message to Employees, Customize Package (modules, events), and ROI Report Generator. This should be a separate interface.
6.  **Membership & Monetization**: Tiered Access Plans (Basic, Plus, Premium), Payment Method integration (Stripe, Apple Pay, employer subsidy), and Referral Program. All sign-in options (Apple, Google) are also required.
7.  **Settings & Integrations**: Profile, Device Sync, Notification Settings, HR Contact Info, and Support/FAQ.
8.  **Team Welly Challenge (Gamification Loop)**: Daily Mini-Challenges, Company Leaderboard, Earn WellyPoints, and Redeem Rewards.
The user clarified that a backend would be added later, placeholder videos are sufficient for now, payment and sign-in options should be fully implemented, the HR/Admin portal will be a separate interface, and both PWA and responsive web design are needed.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React (v18.2.0), Vite (v4.5.14), Tailwind CSS, PWA (Progressive Web App), React Router, Axios for API calls, Context API for state management.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Python,  library, MongoDB (mocked currently), Google Gemini 2.0-flash for AI chatbot.
-   **Deployment**: Vercel, GitHub Pages, Netlify Drop, Surge.sh,  for configuration.

<code_architecture>

Code Architecture: The application is structured as a single-repository project within the  directory. Initially, it was a pure React/Vite frontend application. A backend directory () was later introduced to implement server-side logic and API endpoints.



**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : The primary entry point for the React application. It dictates which root component (, , , ) is rendered. It was frequently modified to switch between different app versions during debugging and integration.
-   : The main application component. Initially, it was a placeholder. It was intended to manage routing and overall layout but underwent significant changes to handle authentication and onboarding flow correctly.
-   : This new file was created to serve as the main application component once backend integration began. It's designed to make API calls and integrate with the FastAPI backend.
-    & : These files establish the authentication context and provide a custom hook for authentication logic (login, logout, signup). They were critical for fixing the onboarding flow issues.
-   : The core FastAPI backend application. This file defines the main FastAPI app instance and includes various API routers. It was initially empty and was rewritten to set up the backend structure, including CORS handling and API endpoint routing.
-   : Manages the database connection. Initially, it aimed for MongoDB, but due to environment constraints, it was adapted to a simplified, non-MongoDB database adapter for mock data.
-   : These files define specific API endpoints for different functionalities (authentication, payments, AI chat, wellness data). They are crucial for exposing backend services to the frontend.
-    & : Essential for Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality, allowing the web app to be installed on mobile devices and offering offline capabilities.
-   : Vercel deployment configuration file. It was problematic initially due to incorrect serverless function configurations for a frontend-only app but was later corrected to properly serve the SPA and handle PWA caching.
-   : Updated to provide comprehensive documentation, including feature overview, tech stack, installation, deployment guides, and architecture explanations.
-   : Specifies Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend, ensuring the server environment is correctly set up.

-   Development of the AI chatbot's user behavior analysis and interaction logic.
-   Integration of actual video content for intro and programs (currently placeholders).
-   Detailed implementation of the HR/Admin portal beyond its current placeholder status.
-   Comprehensive frontend integration with all backend API endpoints for full functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into **Phase 2: Advanced Features & Backend Integration**. The primary focus was setting up the FastAPI backend and beginning its integration with the React frontend.

**Backend Status:**
1.  **Dependencies**:  was populated with necessary Python libraries for FastAPI, authentication (, , ), database interaction (), and third-party integrations (, ). These dependencies were successfully installed.
2.  **Structure**: A comprehensive backend directory () was created, including  with , , , and  for various API functionalities.
3.  **API Endpoints**: Routers for , , , and  were scaffolded. The AI chatbot was specified to use Gemini 2.0-flash.
4.  **Database**: Initial attempts to start MongoDB directly failed due to environment constraints. A decision was made to use a simplified, non-MongoDB database adapter () to allow backend development to proceed.
5.  **Server Status**: The FastAPI backend () was successfully started and confirmed to be running on . Basic API endpoints (health check, secured endpoint) were tested and returned expected responses.

**Frontend Integration Status:**
1.  **New Component**: A new main React component, , was created to handle the interaction with the newly set up backend.
2.  **Dependencies**: The  library was installed in the frontend for making HTTP requests to the backend.
3.  **Entry Point Update**: The  file was updated to render  as the main application component, replacing previous  or  temporary components.
4.  **Styling**:  was updated to support the new .

The current state is that the backend is running with mocked database functionality and initial API structures, and the frontend is being adapted to connect to it. The very last action was preparing to test the complete application with this new frontend-backend integration.
