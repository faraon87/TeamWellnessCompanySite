# Frontend Deployment to Railway - Step by Step Guide

## ðŸš€ Railway Frontend Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
âœ… Backend already deployed successfully to Railway
âœ… Frontend tested locally and integrated with Railway backend
âœ… All files prepared for deployment

### Step 1: Create New Railway Service for Frontend
1. Go to Railway Dashboard (railway.app)
2. Open your existing project (Team Wellness Company)
3. Click "Add Service" â†’ "GitHub Repo" (or "Empty Service" if deploying via CLI)
4. If using GitHub: Select your repository and choose to deploy frontend

### Step 2: Configure Frontend Service
**Important Files Already Prepared:**
- âœ… `package.json` - Contains build and start scripts
- âœ… `yarn.lock` - Dependencies locked
- âœ… `railway-frontend.json` - Railway configuration
- âœ… `vite.config.js` - Build configuration
- âœ… `.env` - Backend URL configured

**Manual Configuration Needed in Railway Dashboard:**

#### Build & Deploy Settings:
- **Build Command**: `yarn build`
- **Start Command**: `yarn preview --port $PORT --host 0.0.0.0`
- **Root Directory**: `/` (current directory)

#### Environment Variables:
Add the following to Railway frontend service:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://teamwellnesscompanysite-production.up.railway.app
```

#### Custom Railway Configuration:
If Railway doesn't auto-detect, upload/use the `railway-frontend.json` file:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "yarn preview --port $PORT --host 0.0.0.0",
    "healthcheckPath": "/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend
1. Trigger deployment from Railway dashboard
2. Monitor build logs for any issues
3. Wait for "Deployed" status

### Step 4: Test Deployed Frontend
Once deployed:
1. Access the generated Railway frontend URL
2. Test OAuth buttons (should redirect to backend â†’ OAuth providers)
3. Test modals and functionality
4. Verify mobile responsiveness

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Frontend loads on Railway URL
- âœ… OAuth buttons redirect to backend then to Google/Apple/Twitter
- âœ… Modals work properly
- âœ… Responsive design across devices
- âœ… No console errors

### Step 5: Update Domain Configuration (Optional)
- Configure custom domain in Railway
- Update DNS records for www.teamwellnesscompany.com
- Test with custom domain

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
1. **Build fails**: Check `yarn.lock` and `package.json` are present
2. **404 errors**: Ensure start command uses correct port variable `$PORT`
3. **CORS errors**: Verify backend CORS allows frontend domain
4. **Asset loading**: Check Vite build configuration

**Files Ready for Deployment:**
- âœ… Frontend source code
- âœ… Build configuration (vite.config.js)
- âœ… Dependencies (package.json, yarn.lock)
- âœ… Environment variables (.env with backend URL)
- âœ… Railway configuration (railway-frontend.json)

## âš¡ Quick Start
1. Create new Railway service
2. Upload/connect this frontend directory
3. Set start command: `yarn preview --port $PORT --host 0.0.0.0`
4. Add environment variable: `VITE_API_URL=https://teamwellnesscompanysite-production.up.railway.app`
5. Deploy!

The frontend is **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** with all configurations prepared!
