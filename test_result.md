# Team Welly App - Test Results

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing First
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- NEVER invoke frontend testing without explicit user permission

### Testing Communication Protocol
- MUST READ and UPDATE this file before invoking any testing agent
- NEVER edit the `Testing Protocol` section
- Testing agents will update this file internally during their run
- Main agent should review test results and act accordingly

### Incorporate User Feedback
- User prefers manual testing over automated testing
- Focus on usability first, then implement all features
- Create placeholders for third-party integrations (no API keys available yet)

## Current Status

### User Problem Statement
Complete revamp of "Team Welly" health and wellness app with focus on:
1. Onboarding Flow (Welcome, Login/Sign-Up, Goal Setting, Assessment)
2. Dashboard (Today's Suggestions, Progress Rings, Bookings, Points)

#### ‚úÖ WORKING ENDPOINTS (14 tests passing):
**Health & Info Endpoints:**
- ‚úÖ Root endpoint (/) - Version 2.0.0 confirmed
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint (/health) - All services reporting healthy
- ‚úÖ API info endpoint (/api/info) - Enhanced features documented

**Enhanced Authentication Endpoints:**
- ‚úÖ Enhanced signup - User creation with session management
- ‚úÖ Demo login - Quick testing authentication working
- ‚úÖ Complete onboarding - User profile updates working
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logout - Session deactivation working

**Enhanced Payment Endpoints:**

- ‚úÖ Create checkout session - Stripe session creation working
- ‚úÖ Create custom checkout session - Custom amount payments working
- ‚úÖ Get checkout status - Payment status tracking working
- ‚úÖ Get payment history - Transaction history retrieval working

**CORS Configuration:**
- ‚úÖ CORS preflight request - Properly configured for localhost:3000

#### ‚ùå FAILING ENDPOINTS (20 tests failing):
**Authentication Issues:**
- ‚ùå Get current user (/api/auth/me) - Session lookup intermittent issues

**Programs Endpoints (All failing - requires implementation):**
- ‚ùå Get all programs, Get programs by category, Get specific program
- ‚ùå Start program, Bookmark program, Complete program
- ‚ùå Get category stats, Get program recommendations

**AI Chat Endpoints (All failing - requires API keys):**
- ‚ùå Chat with AI, Get user insights, Get chat history
- ‚ùå Get wellness tips, Get motivation, Provide AI feedback

**Analytics Endpoints (All failing - requires implementation):**
- ‚ùå Get user analytics, Get behavior analytics, Get progress analytics
- ‚ùå Get wellness score

#### üîß CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:
1. **Fixed Enhanced Authentication**: 
   - Made `create_user_session` function async
   - Fixed database upsert logic for user creation
   - Enhanced session management with proper datetime handling

2. **Enhanced Payment Integration**:
   - All Stripe checkout endpoints working correctly
   - Payment history tracking functional
   - Demo endpoints for testing without API keys

3. **Database Improvements**:
   - Fixed in-memory database query matching for datetime comparisons
   - Improved upsert functionality for user management

#### üìä INTEGRATION STATUS:
- **Enhanced Auth Integration**: ‚úÖ WORKING (Emergent Auth ready)
- **Enhanced Payment Integration**: ‚úÖ WORKING (Stripe configured)
- **AI Chat Integration**: ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES API KEYS (Gemini)
- **Core Programs**: ‚ùå NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- **Analytics**: ‚ùå NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

#### üéØ PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **HIGH**: Implement programs endpoints (8 failing tests)
2. **HIGH**: Implement analytics endpoints (4 failing tests) 
3. **MEDIUM**: Set up AI service API keys for chat functionality
4. **LOW**: Minor session management improvements

### Frontend Testing Results  
*To be updated by frontend testing agent if requested*

## Action Items
1. Test current backend-frontend integration
2. Create placeholders for third-party integrations
3. Provide API key instructions to user
4. Focus on usability improvements
5. Implement core features progressively

## Notes
- User wants manual testing
- No API keys available yet - need placeholders
- Focus on usability first
- Implement all features after usability is solid
