# Team Welly App - Test Results

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing First
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- NEVER invoke frontend testing without explicit user permission

### Testing Communication Protocol
- MUST READ and UPDATE this file before invoking any testing agent
- NEVER edit the `Testing Protocol` section
- Testing agents will update this file internally during their run
- Main agent should review test results and act accordingly

### Incorporate User Feedback
- User prefers manual testing over automated testing
- Focus on usability first, then implement all features
- Create placeholders for third-party integrations (no API keys available yet)

## Current Status

### User Problem Statement
Complete revamp of "Team Welly" health and wellness app with focus on:
1. Onboarding Flow (Welcome, Login/Sign-Up, Goal Setting, Assessment)
2. Dashboard (Today's Suggestions, Progress Rings, Bookings, Points)
3. Programs & Library (Categories, Bookmarking, "Add to My Plan")
4. Live Coaching / Events (1-on-1 Sessions, Group Sessions, Replay Library)
5. HR/Admin Portal (Company Dashboard, Messages, Customization, ROI Reports)
6. Membership & Monetization (Tiered Plans, Payment Integration, Referrals)
7. Settings & Integrations (Profile, Device Sync, Notifications, Support)
8. Team Welly Challenge (Gamification, Leaderboards, Points, Rewards)

### Current Implementation Status
- Phase 2: Backend integration started
- FastAPI backend running on port 8001
- React frontend with BackendIntegratedApp.jsx component
- Mocked database (needs MongoDB integration)
- Basic API routers scaffolded (auth, payments, ai_chat, wellness_data)
- PWA configuration in place
