# Team Welly App - Test Results

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing First
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- NEVER invoke frontend testing without explicit user permission

### Testing Communication Protocol
- MUST READ and UPDATE this file before invoking any testing agent
- NEVER edit the `Testing Protocol` section
- Testing agents will update this file internally during their run
- Main agent should review test results and act accordingly

### Incorporate User Feedback
- User prefers manual testing over automated testing
- Focus on usability first, then implement all features
- Create placeholders for third-party integrations (no API keys available yet)

## Current Status
